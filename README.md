SQL Server Data Domain Boost Scripting Toolkit
=============

The T-SQL folder contains the SQL version of the toolkit.

The intention is to also release a PowerShell version. The T-SQL version
is being released first as it is applicable to more versions of SQL Server.

This scripting toolkit relies on EMC DD Boost for SQL Server executables.
Changes to those executables could affect operation of this toolkit.
Please test new versions before deploying to production environments.
